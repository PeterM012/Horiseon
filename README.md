## Technologies Used
- HTML - Used to create elements on the DOM
- CSS - Styles html elemnts on page 
- Git - version control system to track changes to source code
- GitHub - hosts reposiory that can be deployed to Github Pages

## To Do
- Leave code cleaner
- Make sure Navigation Bar works properly
- Consolidate CSS selectors
- Include Semantic Structure
- Include Comments
- Compliant with Accessibilty standards

## Summary 
This project was to show how to properly refactor and improve the code base for sustainability and accessibility. Using semantic HTML I improved the quality of selectors and properties in CSS. I used comments between each line to provide organization and maintain a healthy form of communication between other developers. I also exceeded expectations with code using alt attributes and optimized the search engine parameters to meet the client's accessibility standards.
